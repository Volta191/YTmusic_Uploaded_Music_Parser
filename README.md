# YTmusic_Uploaded_Music_Parser
Simpe parser for youtube music uploaded songs

If you have big library uploaded on your youtube music account, you may struggle to get a list of tracks form it

This scrips is gets your list uploaded of tracks, then formatting it in "Artist Name" - "Song Name" format and saves it in "tracklist.txt" file.
The txt may be useful for services like "TuneMyMusic" and "Soundiiz"

Before you start:

1. Install ytmusicapi module with:

    pip install ytmusicapi

2. You need to authinticate to your Google account with command in terminal:

    ytmusicapi oaut

3. When authintication is done, simply press enter in terminal. It will generate .json file in same folder with the script

You may control limit of the output buy changing "limit" parameter (3000 by default)

I hope it will help.
